# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, execute all tasks, report when complete.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

**Required skills:** Allways reference the following skills when executing plans:
- **test-driven-development** - REQUIRED: Use for all implementation tasks that involve writing code (TDD)
- **clean-code** - REQUIRED: Use for all implementation tasks that involve writing code
- **vue-best-practices** - REQUIRED: Use for all Vue.js implementation tasks
- **prime-vue** - REQUIRED: Use for any PrimeVue component in Vue.js implementation
- **vueuse-functions** - REQUIRED: Use for any VueUse function in Vue.js implementation
- **vue-testing-best-practices** - REQUIRED: Use for all Vue.js testing tasks
- **vue-router-best-practices** - REQUIRED: Use for any Vue Router implementation tasks

## The Process

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan
1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks

For each task:
1. Mark as in_progress
2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)
3. Run verifications as specified
4. Mark as completed

<!-- ### Step 3: Complete Development

After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use `finishing-a-development-branch` skill to complete the work (merge, PR, or keep branch)
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice -->

## When to Stop and Ask for Help

**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Hit a blocker (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Verification fails repeatedly

**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**

## When to Revisit Earlier Steps

**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking

**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.

## Remember
- Review plan critically first
- Follow plan steps exactly
- Don't skip verifications
- Reference skills when plan says to
- Stop when blocked, don't guess
- Never start implementation on main/master branch without explicit user consent
